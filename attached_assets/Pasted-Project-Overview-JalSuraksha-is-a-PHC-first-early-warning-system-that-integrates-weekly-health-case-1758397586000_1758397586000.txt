Project Overview
JalSuraksha is a PHC-first early warning system that integrates weekly health case logs, rainfall data, and water quality reports to predict water-borne disease outbreaks. The system provides 3+ days lead time for preventive interventions.

Demo Requirements
Core Features to Implement:
Dashboard Interface
Clean, modern UI with health monitoring theme
Real-time risk status display (Green/Yellow/Red alerts)
Map view of Northeast India showing PHC locations and risk zones
Data visualization charts for disease trends and rainfall patterns
Data Collection Module
Simulated PHC weekly case log entry form
Water quality reporting interface
Mobile-responsive design for field workers
Risk Assessment Engine
Rule-based risk scoring algorithm
Display risk factors and reasoning behind alerts
Historical outbreak pattern visualization
Alert System Simulation
Tiered alert generation (Low/Medium/High risk)
PHC verification workflow mockup
SMS alert preview for ASHA workers
Multilingual Support
Interface available in English, Assamese, and Bengali
Language switcher in header
Technical Specifications:
Frontend: React.js or Vue.js with responsive design
Styling: Modern CSS framework (Tailwind/Bootstrap) with health/medical color scheme
Charts: Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
Maps: Leaflet.js or Google Maps for geographic display
Data: Use mock JSON data simulating real PHC reports and weather data
Offline Capability: Show offline mode indicator and sync status
Sample Data to Include:
Mock PHC locations across Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura
Sample disease case data (diarrhea, cholera, typhoid trends)
Rainfall data correlation with outbreak patterns
Water quality test results from different villages
Historical alert examples with outcomes
UI/UX Guidelines:
Colors: Medical blues, greens for safe zones, yellows/reds for alerts
Typography: Clear, readable fonts suitable for healthcare workers
Icons: Healthcare, water, alert, and geographic icons
Mobile-First: Ensure usability on basic smartphones
Accessibility: High contrast, clear labeling for rural users
Key Screens to Build:
Landing/Overview Dashboard - Risk status, recent alerts, key metrics
Data Entry Forms - PHC case logging, water quality reports
Risk Analysis View - Detailed risk scoring with explanations
Alert Management - Current alerts, verification queue, SMS previews
Historical Data - Trends, past outbreaks, system performance metrics
Settings/Config - Language selection, notification preferences
Interactive Elements:
Clickable map markers showing PHC details and risk status
Expandable alert cards with detailed information
Form validation with helpful error messages
Real-time data updates simulation
Filter and search functionality for historical data
Demo Flow:
User lands on dashboard showing current risk status
Can navigate to data entry to simulate PHC worker logging cases
Risk engine updates and shows new alert generation
PHC verification workflow demonstration
Alert dissemination to community simulation
Success Metrics Display:
"3+ Days Earlier Detection" counter
"≥70% Outbreak Detection Rate" progress bar
"≤20% False Alarm Rate" indicator
Impact statistics and community reach numbers
Technical Notes:
Include loading states and offline mode indicators
Add sample notifications and status updates
Implement basic responsive breakpoints
Use placeholder API calls that return realistic mock data
Include print-friendly views for reports
Branding:
Use "JalSuraksha" branding throughout
